# PaperVaultReform
Here we do the reformation of the papervault web app

check out the progress at: https://yashraj-02-techie.github.io/papervaultReform/index.html

Stuff that needs to be worked upon:
-> The grid that hops up when you click on selecting the semester
-> Collecting the papers from Seniors and then posting it
-> Putting the data as a downloadable pdf for now.
-> Build a solid backend that would load the resources and accept user responses rather than just providing pdfs everywhere.
-> We are open for more ideas feel free to contact us for contributing.
-> If you find any issue with the website
