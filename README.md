# PaperVaultReform
Here we do the reformation of the papervault web app

check out the progress at: https://yashraj-02-techie.github.io/papervaultReform/index.html

Stuff that needs to be worked upon:
-> The grid that hops up when you click on selecting the semester

-> Collecting the papers from Seniors and then posting it

-> Putting the data as a downloadable pdf for now.

-> Build a solid backend that would load the resources and accept user responses rather than just providing pdfs everywhere.

-> We are open for more ideas feel free to contact us for contributing.

-> If you find any issue with the website raise the issue and we will try and sort it out ASAP.

-> If you want to contribute fork the repo, do your changes and create a PR. If we find it compatible we will merge it to the final code.
